 <h2> Description </h2>
  <h3> An intuitive assistant for architects that aids them with building regulations </h3>
Kaibo is an app that serves as an assistant to architects, helping architects to navigate through the multiple intractable webs of building regulations.  
 <br/> <br/>
It will provide checklists for monitoring compliances with regulations from different technical agencies, provide an interactive 3D display for architects to intuitively understand the context of the regulation, and answer any ad-hoc questions regarding regulations that architects may have - i.e. questions that the authorities cannot give a clear answer for quickly. 
 <br/> <br/>
A community of architects will be created over this platform - i.e. asking their questions via community forums, under the guidance of officers from the different technical agencies.
